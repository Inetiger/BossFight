# BossFight

So this is kind of funny, but I've already done this task 3 times, because I were the first to complete Moodle before the task and bonus task were added, i startet my own projects and this was just like the one I started, then the bonus tasks were added and another just like this one and the this again. So im quite familiar with what I had to do here. That said it's not a bad task, long from it, it's quite fun.

## What does it do?

The program starts of creating a Hero and a Villain, you are the player of Hero and a script controls the Villain, some simple rules is added that you can't fight if you don't have enough stamina simple enough for both Hero and Villain to always choose the right choice so the damage Villain does is random from 0-30dmg. It's a stupid workaround but it works and would have to change if it were to be used differently.
